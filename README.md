# Theory-of-Algorithms-Project
## Project Outine
This repository contains all work done for my 4th Year module Theory of Algorithms. The objective of the project is to create the SHA-512, *Standard-Hash Algorithm*. The program is written in the C programming language. The program will take the name or path of a file as a command line arguement and output the SHA-512 digest of it. This is to be coded from scratch using **ONLY** the standard C library.

## File Structure

## How to Run

## What is the SHA-512 and why is it important?

## Module Questions
The module requires answering 3 questions. Each question is related to the topics covered in the module Theory of Algorithm. These topics include the Secure Hash Standard, Standard-Hash Algorithms (SHA) 256 and 512, Turing Machines, and more. The questions are labeled 1-3 and answer up to 500 words each below.
#### 1). Why can't we reverse the SHA-512 algorithm to retrience the original message from a hash digest?
#### 2). Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input message that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?
#### 3). How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeroes?
